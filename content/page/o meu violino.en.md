## Brief History of the Guarnerius
The city of Cremona, Italy, was in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth century birthplace of notable families of luthiers, among others Amati, Guarnerius, Stradivarius and Ruggeris, who designed this city throughout Europe as the first and largest center of violin construction. 

For the circumstance and space available, a brief history of the Guarnerius family and some surrounding facts will be narrated here. :smiley:

Andrea (1626-1698), the first luthier of the family, makes his apprenticeship in the workshop of Nicolau Amati, as confirmed by the description of one of his labels: "Andrea Guarnerius alumnus Nicolau Amati fecit Cremonae sub title Sanctae Terefiae 16..".

They're two of his sons continuing the art of luthier.

Pedro (1655-1720) besides being a disciple of his father, made musical training in the area of violin and viola. In the eighties it leaves Cremona to come to settle in the city of Mantua. In addition to collaborating as an instrumentalist in the city's orchestra, violins continue to be made, recognized as the most exquisite in the family. It's going to be in the history of luthier like Pietro de Mantua.

The other son, Joseph (1666-1739), did his training at Casa Guarnerius, which he came to lead after his father's death.

Two of his six children continue the tradition.

The second Peter (1695-1761) around 1724 left Cremona on his way to Venice, where the musical environment was of great prestige, rivaling other centers such as Rome and Florence. His work has some distinct originalities from its predecessors and the influence of the Venetian school. It is curious that this luthier came to be connected to the city with the name of "Pietro de Veneza" as happened to his uncle.

Joseph (1698-1744) remained in the Guarnerius house where he is his father's apprentice and assistant until about 1722, when he created his own workshop in the city of Cremona, thus starting a work marked by creativity and change, in relation to the family school. The contour, toarching and thickness of the tops, the shape and dimensions of the eupheas and the very variable sculpture of the heads are unique characteristics of their violins, in addition to the acoustic qualities. The refinement of the work did not reach the levels of other family members.

It is no accident that a French amateur violinist, and banker, offered Nicolau Paganini (1782-1840) a violin built by Joseph Guarnerius(II) in 1743, which was during his lifetime the preferred instrument and who came to baptize him "Cannon" for possessing a great sound power.

Paganini donates this violin to his native Genoa, now preserved and exhibited in a beautiful closet of the Town Hall at the Town Hall, Tursi Palace, as I had the opportunity to visualize in 1999.

Although the labels do not confirm any qualities to the instruments, it is interesting to note here some curiosities.

As mentioned above, Andrea printed on her label: "sub title Sanctae Terefie", everything leads to believe that this reference to Saint Teresa the luthier wanted to externalize a certain religious devotion.

Also the children print on their own labels the name if Santa Teresa, in addition to adding the family connection: "philius Andrea".

The grandson Joseph leaves aside these references and prints a cross and the monogram JHS –Jesus Hominum Salvator – religious symbol consecrated in the Christian Empire.

It is believable that Joseph printed this monogram by imagining Jesus being by his side when building his violins. However, another hypothesis was put, that of Joseph having received education in a school of the Society of Jesus, jesuit order that used jhs as a symbol. Regardless of the certainties or doubts about these references, the fact is that this talented luthier came to be consecrated in history as "Guarnerius del Gesu" or simply "del Gesu".

In 1994 twenty-five violins of "del Gesu" are exhibited at the Metropolitane Museum in New York, among which was the famous "Cannon".

As part of this exhibition, which takes place 250 years after his death, two rich books were published under the title "Giuseppe Guarneri del Gesu". The first volume contains several wonderful photographs of these life-size violins, in addition to the brief history of each of them. In the second volume is narrated the life of this luthier. It also has very interesting contents such as measurements and thicknesses of the tops, details of the ephemes and heads, contour designs and arching of the tops. The annex also contains a "List of Subscribers" from several countries. From Portugal only my name is mentioned, Joaquim Capela, but joaquim Domingos Capela should be in order to avoid any confusion.

With these violins were recorded works of famous composers by the great violinist Elmar Oliveira, the first American to win the gold medal (1st Prize) at the Tchaikovsky International Competition in 1978 in Moscow. He was born on June 28, 1950 in Waterbury, Connecticut, the son of a couple of Portuguese emigrants from Murtosa, Aveiro.

## A Construção do Violino
No ano 2000 construí o meu violino nº 9 que procura ser uma cópia do *“Cannon”*. Para o efeito foram usados elementos fotográficos e geométricos contidos nos dois volumes referidos.

O tampo harmónico, em pinho dos Alpes e formado de duas partes, apresenta anéis de crescimento (veio ou fibra) estreitos no centro, alargando-se para o lado exterior. Os éfes, longilíneos e pontiagudos, recortados com bastante rigor, retratam uma das características mais emblemáticas dos violinos de “del Gesu”. A barra harmónica, posicionada segundo a regra de um sétimo, tem a altura de 12,5mm e a espessura de 5mm.

O fundo é de ácer com o ondulado disposto simétricamente próximo do original, mas no sentido descendente. O tampo e o fundo têm contornos e arqueamentos do original, mas as espessuras desviam-se parcialmente porque se procurou uma afinação com o intervalo de meio-tom entre eles, atingindo-se respectivamente ré# e mi. Os pesos ficaram com 70 e 102 gramas.

As ilhargas, enformadas em molde exterior, são de ácer ondulado disposto simetricamente. Estas estão ligadas por blocos e sanefas em pinho dos Alpes e no conjunto o peso é de 54 gramas.

As cabeças dos violinos de “del Gesu” são de uma geometria muito variável e apresentam um acabamento pouco cuidado. A do “Cannon” tem um aspecto densamente massivo e contrasta com outras frontalmente adelgaçadas. Não será exagerado lembrar aqui um velho ditado: ”cada cabeça , cada sentença”. Por analogia poder-se-ia dizer: “cada violino, cada cabeça”.

O verniz, aplicado à trincha, foi formulado na base de álcool e de resinas, tais como sandaraca, mastique em lágrimas, goma laca sem cera, goma elemi, essência de terbentina, essência de lavanda, óleo castor, etc.. A côr, levemente castanha, foi obtida pela adição de corantes como extracto de ratânia, goma guta, santal e aloés.

A montagem do cavalete, alma, cravelhas, cordas e estandarte baseou-se nas regras padronizadas para o violino moderno, não deixando contudo de haver correcções ao gosto do próprio violeiro.

Os parâmetros acústicos violino, nomeadamente potência, projecção, igualdade entre cordas, características tímbricas e “playability” dominam o som procurado pelos instrumentistas. E é este actor o verdadeiro juiz. No caso presente o juiz do meu violino será o violinista [Gaspar Fonseca dos Santos][eu], para quem foi construído.
